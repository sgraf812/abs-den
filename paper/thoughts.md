# TODO

* CESK: Decide whether we want to return a balanced trace or not
* CESK: Work on specification of S
* Stateful: write down, think about cache/heap correspondence
* Work out example. Rule of signs? Need to bloat language. Throws exception?
  Liveness? What's the difference? Constant folding? Control-flow analysis?
