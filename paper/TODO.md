# Structure

## Introduction

- Point out structural mismatch problem
- Question: Should we start from Small-Step/Big-Step Shared Abstract
            Interpreters or from denotational semantics?
  * What we have now is a good start. We simply need to stress the
    development on Abstract Definitional Interpreters more and say why it is not
    an option.
    * Big-Step style Definitional interpreters such as the meta-circular one by
      Reynolds and the one by Ager are structurally defined, we call these
      Denootational Interprers...
    * ... and Abstracting Definitional interpreters offers a mechanism to derive
      sound analysis from a shared definitional interpreter
    * ... but the meta language is not total; hence it is a far cry from a
      formal semantics. The problem is exacerbated for structural denotational interpreters
